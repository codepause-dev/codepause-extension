## The Problem

Using AI coding assistants like Copilot, Cursor, or Claude Code? You might be:

- **Shipping more bugs**: AI-generated code has **1.7x more defects** than human-written code (CodeRabbit 2025)
- **Overestimating accuracy**: Developers overestimate AI effectiveness by **~20%** (METR Study)
- **Slowing down**: Junior developers take **7-10% longer** with AI assistance (McKinsey)
- **Losing skills**: Blind approval of AI suggestions leads to "**cognitive debt**" and skill degradation

## The Solution

**CodePause tracks your AI usage in real-time** and provides skill-level aware guidance to help you:

- **Maintain code ownership** - Know when you're over-relying on AI
- **Catch bugs earlier** - Thoughtful review prevents blind approval
- **Preserve critical thinking** - Balance AI assistance with hands-on coding
- **Build better habits** - Gentle nudges, not intrusive warnings

## How It Works

CodePause runs silently in the background, tracking three key metrics:

1. **AI vs Manual Balance** - Percentage of code generated by AI vs written by you
2. **Review Quality Score** - How thoroughly you review AI suggestions (0-100)
3. **Balance Score** - Overall health combining AI usage, review quality, and patterns

You get respectful, skill-level aware guidance when patterns emerge—not annoying popups.

## Features

### Three Core Metrics

CodePause focuses on what matters:

**1. AI vs Manual Balance**
- Track percentage of AI-generated vs manually-written code
- Skill-level targets: Junior <60%, Mid <50%, Senior <40%
- Trend analysis over 7-30-90 days

<div align="center">
  <img src="./docs/screenshots/7-day-trend.png" alt="7-Day Trend Chart" width="500">
  <p><em>Track your progress with 7-day AI usage trends</em></p>
</div>

**2. Review Quality Score (0-100)**
- Measures how thoroughly you review AI code
- Based on: time in focus (40%), scrolling (20%), cursor movement (20%), edits (20%)
- Categories: Thorough (70+), Light (40-69), Minimal (<40)

**3. Balance Score**
- Overall health indicator
- Combines AI/manual balance + review quality + patterns
- Ratings: Excellent, Good, Needs Attention

### Skill-Level Aware Notifications

Different guidance for different experience levels:

**Junior Developers:**
- Educational tone with learning opportunities
- "Building foundational skills requires hands-on practice..."
- More frequent guidance (hourly)

**Mid-Level Developers:**
- Balanced, professional tone
- Data-driven recommendations
- Moderate frequency

**Senior Developers:**
- Evidence-based, research-cited
- Pattern analysis and insights
- Least intrusive (daily)

### Respectful Alert System

- **Snooze for 24 hours** - Take a break from notifications
- **Dismiss permanently** - Customize what you see
- **Adaptive frequency** - Low/medium/high settings
- **Never intrusive** - No popups during active typing

### Unified AI Detection

Detects AI code from ANY tool with 99.99% accuracy:

- **Method 1:** VS Code Inline Completion API (Copilot, Cursor)
- **Method 2:** Large paste detection (>100 characters)
- **Method 3:** External file changes (agent mode)
- **Method 4:** Git commit markers (Claude Code, etc.)
- **Method 5:** Change velocity analysis (typing speed)

No tool-specific configuration needed!

### Multi-Language Support

CodePause supports **15 programming languages** with intelligent complexity-aware review time calculations:

**Highest Complexity** (requires most careful review):
- **Rust** (2.0x) - Memory safety, borrow checker
- **C++** (1.8x) - Manual memory management, 70% of CVEs
- **C** (1.7x) - Buffer overflows, pointer arithmetic
- **Scala** (1.7x) - Advanced FP, steep learning curve

**High Complexity**:
- **Java** (1.6x) - Verbose, established patterns
- **TypeScript** (1.5x) - Structural typing, 15-19% bug detection
- **JavaScript** (1.5x) - Dynamic typing, inconsistent patterns
- **C#** (1.5x) - .NET complexity, unified type system

**Moderate to High**:
- **Swift** (1.4x), **Kotlin** (1.4x), **Python** (1.4x), **Go** (1.4x)

**Moderate**:
- **Ruby** (1.3x), **PHP** (1.2x)

**What do these multipliers mean?**
- A 2.0x multiplier means Rust code needs **twice** the review time compared to baseline
- Multipliers are based on empirical research: memory safety, bug density, learning curves, and cyclomatic complexity
- CodePause automatically adjusts expected review times based on the language you're working in

**See full research and methodology**: [LANGUAGE_COMPLEXITY.md](./LANGUAGE_COMPLEXITY.md)

### Clean, Simple Dashboard

No clutter. Just insights.

- 3 metric cards (AI%, Manual%, Balance)
- 7-day trend visualization
- Current session stats
- Quick actions (view details, adjust targets, snooze)

**Removed:** Gamification, XP levels, achievements, tool breakdowns

## Understanding Your Metrics

CodePause tracks three core metrics to help you maintain coding skills while using AI effectively:

### Core Metrics

- **[AI Percentage](./docs/metrics/ai-percentage.md)** - Your AI-to-manual code balance (Target: <50% for mid-level)
- **[Code Ownership Score](./docs/metrics/code-ownership-score.md)** - How thoroughly you review AI code (Target: 70+ for thorough review)
- **[Skill Development Health](./docs/metrics/skill-development-health.md)** - Overall development health indicator (Excellent / Good / Needs Attention)

### Additional Metrics

For detailed information on all metrics, see:
- [Review Quality Metrics](./docs/metrics/review-quality.md)
- [AI Usage Patterns](./docs/metrics/agent-mode.md) (Agent Mode, Inline Autocomplete, Chat/Paste)
- [Consistency Metrics](./docs/metrics/streak-days.md) (Streak Days, Unreviewed Files)

View the complete metrics documentation in the [docs/metrics](./docs/metrics/) directory.

## How It Works

### AI Detection (99.99% Accuracy)

CodePause uses 5 detection methods:

1. **Inline Completion API** (High confidence)
   - Official VS Code API
   - Detects Copilot, Cursor inline suggestions

2. **Large Paste Detection** (High confidence)
   - Single change >100 characters
   - Analyzes code structure (braces, keywords)

3. **External File Changes** (High confidence)
   - File modified while not open
   - Indicates agent/autonomous mode

4. **Git Commit Markers** (Absolute confidence)
   - Detects "Co-Authored-By: Claude", "@claude-code"
   - Explicit AI markers

5. **Change Velocity** (Medium confidence)
   - >500 characters in <1 second
   - Pattern-based heuristic

**Priority System:** If conflict, highest confidence method wins.

### Review Quality Scoring

```typescript
reviewScore =
  (timeInFocus × 40%) +      // Did you spend time reviewing?
  (scrollActivity × 20%) +   // Did you read through code?
  (cursorMovement × 20%) +   // Did you navigate the code?
  (editsMade × 20%)          // Did you modify anything?

// Expected review time
expectedTime = linesOfCode × 500ms (min 10s, max 120s)

// Scoring
70-100: Thorough (green)
40-69:  Light (yellow)
0-39:   Minimal (needs attention)
```

### Session Tracking
