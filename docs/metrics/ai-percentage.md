# AI Percentage

**Your AI-to-manual code balance - the foundation of code authorship.**

## Quick Summary

AI Percentage measures what portion of your code was written by AI tools versus manually by you. It's calculated as: `(AI lines / total lines) × 100`. Lower percentages mean you're writing more code yourself.

---

## Why It Matters

This metric is crucial because research shows that over-reliance on AI can:

- **Erode fundamental skills** - Juniors who depend heavily on AI lose problem-solving abilities
- **Introduce more bugs** - AI-generated code has 1.7x more bugs than manually written code (CodeRabbit 2025)
- **Create knowledge gaps** - You can't maintain what you don't understand
- **Impact hiring** - 54% of engineering leaders are hiring fewer juniors due to AI-related skill gaps

**The Goal:** Use AI as a tool to augment your skills, not replace them.

---

## How It's Calculated

```typescript
AI Percentage = (Total AI Lines / Total Lines) × 100

Where:
- Total AI Lines = Lines generated by Copilot + Cursor + Claude Code + other AI tools
- Total Lines = AI Lines + Manual Lines (code you typed yourself)
- Manual Lines = Lines you wrote without AI assistance
```

### Detection Methods

CodePause uses 5 methods to detect AI-generated code:

1. **Inline Completion API** (99.9% accuracy) - Official VS Code API
2. **Large Paste Detection** - Blocks >100 characters pasted at once
3. **External File Changes** - Files modified while closed (agent mode)
4. **Git Commit Markers** - Detects "Co-Authored-By: Claude" signatures
5. **Change Velocity** - Typing speed analysis (>500 chars in <1 second)

**Example Calculation:**

```
Morning coding session:
- Wrote 150 lines manually
- Accepted 100 lines from Copilot
- Claude Code generated 50 lines in agent mode

Total Lines = 150 + 100 + 50 = 300
AI Lines = 100 + 50 = 150
AI Percentage = (150 / 300) × 100 = 50%
```

## What Good Looks Like

Your ideal AI percentage depends on your experience level:

| Experience Level | Target AI % | Reasoning |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Junior** | **< 40%** | Build fundamentals first - you need hands-on practice to develop core skills |
| **Mid-Level** | **< 60%** | Balanced approach - leverage AI but maintain skill development |
| **Senior** | **< 75%** | High leverage - you have the expertise to properly review and use AI |

### Why These Thresholds?

These are **research-backed targets** based on 2025 studies:

- **Juniors need MORE manual coding** to build pattern recognition and problem-solving skills
- **Seniors can use MORE AI** because they have the expertise to spot issues and review properly
- **Mid-levels balance** between learning and productivity

**Important:** These are guidelines, not hard rules. Your actual "good" percentage depends on:
- Type of work (exploratory vs. production)
- Project phase (prototyping vs. refactoring)
- Your personal learning goals

## Thresholds & Scoring

### Junior Developers (< 40% AI)

**Green Zone (0-30%):** Excellent balance. You're building strong fundamentals.

**Yellow Zone (31-40%):** Good balance. Consider if you're learning from AI suggestions.

**Red Zone (41%+):** Over-reliant on AI. You may be missing skill development opportunities.

### Mid-Level Developers (< 60% AI)

**Green Zone (0-50%):** Great balance between productivity and skill maintenance.

**Yellow Zone (51-60%):** Acceptable. Be conscious about what you're letting AI handle.

**Red Zone (61%+):** AI dependency risk. Review whether you're maintaining your edge.

### Senior Developers (< 75% AI)

**Green Zone (0-65%):** Optimal leverage. You're using AI effectively as a force multiplier.

**Yellow Zone (66-75%):** High AI usage. Ensure you're reviewing code critically.

**Red Zone (76%+):** AI over-reliance. Even seniors need to maintain hands-on skills.

## Examples & Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Junior Developer - Too High

```
Week 1 Stats:
- AI Percentage: 72%
- Manual Lines: 280
- AI Lines: 720

Analysis: Over-reliant on AI. Missing opportunities to practice.

Action Steps:
1. Try solving problems manually before using AI
2. Modify AI suggestions significantly instead of accepting as-is
3. Write tests and documentation manually
4. Focus on understanding WHY code works, not just THAT it works
```

### Scenario 2: Senior Developer - Good Balance

```
Week 1 Stats:
- AI Percentage: 58%
- Manual Lines: 840
- AI Lines: 1160

Analysis: Healthy balance. Using AI for boilerplate while maintaining ownership.

Observations:
- Wrote all architecture and critical logic manually
- Used AI for repetitive patterns and data transformations
- Heavily modified AI suggestions (high edit rate)
- Maintained strong code review discipline
```

### Scenario 3: Mid-Level Developer - Ideal Range

```
Day's Work:
- Built new API endpoint (mostly manual): 120 lines
- Copilot helped with error handling: 40 lines
- Wrote tests manually: 80 lines
- AI generated mock data: 30 lines

Total: 270 lines (70 AI) = 26% AI
Result: Excellent! Using AI strategically for grunt work.
```

## Tips to Improve (Lower AI %)

### For Juniors: Build Your Foundation

1. **Start without AI** - Write the first draft manually, then use AI for refinement
2. **Learn patterns** - Study the code AI generates, then recreate similar patterns yourself
3. **Type it out** - Even if you know AI could do it, type it manually to build muscle memory
4. **Explain to yourself** - Before accepting AI code, explain what it does line-by-line
5. **Challenge yourself** - Set "manual mode" days where you avoid AI completely

### For Mid-Levels: Strategic AI Usage

1. **AI for boilerplate** - Use AI for repetitive patterns you already understand
2. **Manual for logic** - Write business logic and algorithms yourself
3. **Learn new patterns** - When AI suggests something unfamiliar, research it before accepting
4. **Refactor AI code** - Accept AI suggestions but always refactor to your standards
5. **Test coverage** - Write all tests manually to ensure understanding

### For Seniors: Maintain Your Edge

1. **Architecture stays manual** - Never let AI design your system architecture
2. **Critical paths by hand** - Write security-critical and performance-sensitive code manually
3. **Review rigorously** - Treat AI code like junior developer code (because it is)
4. **Teach through code** - Writing code manually sets better examples for your team
5. **Stay sharp** - Regular manual coding keeps your skills fresh for when it matters

### Universal Tips (All Levels)

- **Set daily limits** - "Today I'll keep AI under 40%" - conscious goal-setting works
- **Track your progress** - Watch your 7-day trend in the dashboard
- **Mix it up** - Alternate between AI-heavy tasks (data transforms) and manual work (core logic)
- **Learn from rejections** - When you reject AI suggestions, understand why
- **Pair programming** - Real pair programming (with humans) teaches more than AI
- **Side projects** - Build personal projects without AI to maintain pure coding skills

## Understanding the Research

### Why Lower AI % is Often Better

**GitClear 2025 Study:**
- AI-generated code has 1.7x more bugs
- AI code gets reverted more frequently
- Code maintainability suffers with high AI usage

**Stanford/LeadDev 2025:**
- Junior developer employment fell 20% (2022-2025)
- 54% of engineering leaders hiring fewer juniors
- Reason: AI dependency led to skill gaps

**METR 2025:**
- Developers overestimate AI effectiveness by ~20%
- High AI usage correlates with 19% slower task completion
- Critical thinking skills decline with AI over-reliance

### The Paradox

**More AI ≠ More Productivity** (beyond a threshold)

The relationship is an inverted U-curve:
- 0-30% AI: Productivity boost from automation
- 30-60% AI: Balanced productivity and learning
- 60%+ AI: Diminishing returns, skill erosion begins

## FAQ

**Q: Should I always try to keep AI % as low as possible?**

A: No. The goal isn't to avoid AI entirely - it's to use it strategically. Writing boilerplate manually wastes time. The key is: use AI for things you already understand, and code manually for things you need to learn or that are critical.

**Q: My AI % is high because I'm refactoring. Is that bad?**

A: Context matters. High AI % during refactoring sessions is normal - you're transforming existing patterns. What matters is that you understand and review what's being changed. Check your Code Ownership Score.

**Q: I'm a senior dev with 80% AI. Should I worry?**

A: Probably yes. Even seniors need to maintain their skills. Ask yourself: Could you rebuild your current project without AI? If no, you're over-dependent. Aim to reduce to 65-75%.

**Q: How quickly should I lower my AI %?**

A: Gradually. Don't go cold turkey. Reduce by 5-10% per week until you hit your target. Sudden drops can hurt productivity and motivation.

**Q: Does AI % include code I heavily modified?**

A: Yes, if AI suggested it initially. However, heavy modifications increase your Code Ownership Score, which is good! The two metrics balance each other.

**Q: What about using AI for learning new technologies?**

A: Great use case! When learning, higher AI % is acceptable temporarily. But make sure to:
1. Type out AI examples manually (don't copy-paste)
2. Modify examples significantly
3. Return to normal AI % once you've learned the basics
