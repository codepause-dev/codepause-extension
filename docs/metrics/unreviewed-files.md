# Unreviewed Files

**AI-generated files you haven't properly inspected yet.**

## Quick Summary

Unreviewed Files lists all files with AI-generated code that have a review score below 70. These are "technical debt in waiting" - code you own but don't understand. Every unreviewed file is a liability.

---

## Why It Matters

Unreviewed files are dangerous:
- **Production bugs:** Code may not work correctly
- **Security risks:** Vulnerabilities you haven't spotted
- **Maintenance burden:** Can't fix what you don't understand
- **Team confusion:** Teammates ask questions you can't answer
- **Ownership failure:** You signed your name to code you never read

**The rule:** Never end your day with unreviewed files. Ever.

## What Qualifies as "Unreviewed"

A file is unreviewed if:
- **Review score < 70** (rushed or no review)
- Generated by AI (any mode)
- Still exists in codebase

**How to get off the list:**
1. Open file in editor
2. Read through implementation
3. Scroll through entire file
4. Click into multiple locations
5. Make edits/improvements
6. Spend adequate time (gets score to 70+)

OR manually mark as reviewed (if reviewed in terminal/git diff).

## Target Thresholds

| Files Needing Review | Status | Action |
|---------------------|--------|--------|
| **0-2** | Green | Excellent ownership |
| **3-5** | Yellow | Catch up today |
| **6-10** | Orange | Significant debt |
| **11+** | Red | Crisis - stop generating, start reviewing |

## Review Priority

**Priority order:**
1. **Security-related files** (auth, permissions, data access)
2. **Core business logic** (primary features)
3. **Public APIs** (interfaces others depend on)
4. **Tests** (bad tests worse than no tests)
5. **Everything else** (configs, utilities, docs)

---

## Dashboard Actions

**Files Needing Review section shows:**
- File name and path
- Lines generated
- Tool that generated it
- Time since generation (prioritize oldest)

**Quick actions:**
1. **"Review"** button - Opens file in editor
2. **"Mark as Reviewed"** - For files reviewed elsewhere
3. Checkbox to batch-review multiple files

## Best Practices

### Daily Workflow

**End of day checklist:**
1. Check unreviewed files count
2. If > 0: Review before leaving
3. If > 5: Stop using AI, catch up on reviews
4. Never carry debt to tomorrow

### Agent Mode Sessions

**After every agent session:**
1. Review all generated files immediately
2. Don't start new work until reviewed
3. Time-box: 5-10 minutes per file minimum

### Prevention

**Reduce unreviewed files by:**
1. Using less agent mode (more inline)
2. Reviewing as you code (not batching)
3. Generating less code per session
4. Improving review speed (practice)

**Remember:** Every unreviewed file is a lie. You're telling git "I wrote this" when you didn't even read it. Own your code or don't accept it.

**The test:** Can you explain every file in your last commit? If not, you have unreviewed files.
