# Streak Days

**Consecutive days of coding activity - building consistency.**

## Quick Summary

Streak Days counts how many consecutive days you've written code (AI or manual). Even 10 lines counts. Streaks build habit and maintain skill sharpness. Think "Duolingo for coding."

---

## Why It Matters

Consistency beats intensity for skill retention:
- **Muscle memory:** Daily coding builds neural pathways
- **Pattern recognition:** Regular exposure improves intuition
- **Skill maintenance:** Skills decay faster than you think
- **Habit formation:** 30-day streak = habit locked in
- **Interview readiness:** Daily practice keeps you sharp

**Research shows:** Developers who code 6-7 days/week retain skills 3x better than those who code 2-3 days/week, even with same total hours.

## Calculation

```
Streak = Consecutive days with 10+ lines of code

Breaks when:
- Day with 0 lines of code (or <10 lines)
- Resets to 0, starts counting again next active day

Example:
Mon: 150 lines (streak = 1)
Tue: 200 lines (streak = 2)
Wed: 5 lines (too few, streak = 0)
Thu: 100 lines (streak = 1)
Fri: 80 lines (streak = 2)
```

## Streak Goals

| Streak | Achievement | What It Means |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **7 days** | One Week | Building habit |
| **14 days** | Two Weeks | Habit forming |
| **30 days** | One Month | Habit established |
| **100 days** | Elite | Consistent master |
| **365 days** | Year | True dedication |

## Maintaining Streaks

### Weekend Strategy

**Problem:** Work coding doesn't count on weekends

**Solutions:**
1. **15-minute morning coding** - LeetCode, personal project
2. **Open source contributions** - Even documentation counts
3. **Learning projects** - Try new technologies
4. **Code review** - Review others' code (if you edit)
5. **Blogging with code examples** - Counts as writing code

### Travel/Vacation

**Keep streaks during travel:**
- 10 minutes before bed
- Airport/plane coding on laptop
- Mobile coding apps (for simple practice)
- Plan ahead: batch code day before

**OR: Let it break.**  Rest is important too. Streaks are motivational, not mandatory.

**Remember:** Streaks are motivational tools, not chains. Missing a day doesn't make you a bad developer. But consistent practice does make you better.
